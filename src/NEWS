satyr 0.15
==========
Fixed issues found in a security audit. Fixed the compat version of duphash
generation which were not refusing to produce duphash for completely unreliable
oopses. Fixed parsing of invalid syntax Python exceptions which were not
recognized and caused satyr to refuse such a Python exception. Fixed unwinding
of VDSO frames on i386. Limit the number of frames unwound to deal with
infinite recursion.  Support authentication data, use dummy values for some
missing members and include DESKTOP_SESSION in uReport. Ignore suppressed Java
exceptions causing satyr to fail to parse such an Java exceptions. Quality
frame has to have file name because almost all frames has function name because
of MiniDebuginfo.
